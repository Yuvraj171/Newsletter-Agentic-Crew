  <h1>IoT-Driven Digital Twins</h1>

  <section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Imagine having a virtual copy of your factory or equipment that mirrors everything happening in real-time. That's the power of IoT-driven Digital Twins. These digital replicas use data from sensors to simulate, predict problems, and improve performance without disrupting the real-world operations. This technology is transforming manufacturing, paving the way for smarter factories and more efficient processes.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="who-is-using-it">
  <h2>Who is Using It Already?</h2>
  <p>Several major companies are already leveraging digital twins to enhance their operations:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Siemens:</b> Uses virtual models of industrial equipment like turbines, combined with real-time IoT data, to monitor performance, predict failures, and optimize maintenance.</li>
  <li><b>General Electric (GE):</b> Employs digital twins in aviation and power generation to track engine performance, anticipate maintenance needs, and optimize fuel use, minimizing downtime and boosting efficiency.</li>
  <li><b>BMW:</b> Creates virtual factory models to design and refine manufacturing processes, identify bottlenecks, streamline workflows, and improve overall efficiency.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="benefits">
